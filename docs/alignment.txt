Initial alignment occurs when the user clicks the 'Automatic setup scripts' in the a_GUI_setup_main.py.
This file in turn calls:
utilties/a_script_preprocess_2.py which in turn calls:
utilities/align_compose.py which in turn calls:
align_v3.py just calls: align_sequential.py which runs elastix on each file, which aligns current to previous

elastic command is:
-f fixed_image is: previous image
-m moving image is: current image
-p parameter file is : preprocess/parameters/Parameters_Rigid_MutualInfo.txt
elastix -f previous.tif -m current.tif -out newtif -p parameter_file,
            'param_fp': param_fp,
            'output_subdir': output_subdir,
            'fixed_fp': prev_fp,
            'moving_fp': curr_fp
            })



compose_v3.py creates a dictionary of image name,

and then:

warp_crop.py

add inline at bottom of slide admin.
