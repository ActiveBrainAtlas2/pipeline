### Usability checklist

Here is a list of things to check after deploying software to the server

1. login to https://activebrainatlas.ucsd.edu/activebrainatlas/admin
2. Check https://activebrainatlas.ucsd.edu/activebrainatlas/admin/neuroglancer/urlmodel/ and search for **test_save_annotation**. Open the neuroglancer link and create a copy of it by clicking new. 
3. move the points around and click save
4. open a new annotation layer and import the saved annotations from the drop down
5. locate the saved annotations in the admin portal.  Confirm that the coordinate match the data in neuroglancer and that the Animal ID, structure and annotator information is correct.
6. Delete the added test point after checking
7. Check https://activebrainatlas.ucsd.edu/activebrainatlas/admin/neuroglancer/urlmodel/ and search for **test save annotations**. Find the new entry you created and delete it using the action drop down.
