# Todo June 24
1. Get three brains. Use the three reference brains. MD589, MD585, MD594.
1. How do we prepare the contours to add to CVAT?
1. The existing contours are specific to a brain.
1. Need an average atlas of the structures. 
1. Need an alignment of these structures
1. Put in dates for workflow graph

# Todo June 10
1. Ed - align thumbnail masks from Channel 1 from 3 brains
1. Ed - document file structure, with tree
1. Kui - Transform aligned auto-masks into data for data annotations.
1. Sidd and Litao - Incorporate microns into neuroglancer global alignment
1. Sidd and Litao  - Make structure annotation filled in.
1. Sidd and Litao and Ed (contact alex) - find high resolution for the ground truth of the structures, and transformation of ground truth into 
segmentation into neuroglancer.
1. Kui and Beth to correct the masks.
1. Sidd and Litao - work with Beth on the usability of the annnotation tool in neuroglancer. (Make it easy to use)
 1. Start with midsection for clarity and ease of use.
 1. After you get the midsection, get can rotate and scale on the midsection will make it easier to go to other structures.
 1. Needs to be biology centered for the end user.
 1. Start with a zoomed out version. Get the center.
 1. Then zoom in and look for the midsection.
 1. Find the averaged volumns, 11am.
